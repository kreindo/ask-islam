## üß† How It Works

Ask Islam uses advanced AI models (GPT-4o) with specialized prompt engineering to provide accurate and respectful information about Islamic topics. The system is designed to:

1. Understand questions about various Islamic subjects
2. Provide factual information based on authentic sources
3. Cite references from the Quran and Hadith collections
4. Acknowledge different scholarly interpretations when appropriate
5. Respond with cultural sensitivity and respect

### üîÆ Future Model Development

**Coming Soon**: We are developing a custom-made AI model specifically fine-tuned for Islamic knowledge. This specialized model will be trained on authentic Islamic texts, including the Quran, Hadith collections, and scholarly works, to provide even more accurate and nuanced responses on Islamic topics.

## üìù Usage Examples

Here are some example questions you can ask:

- "What are the five pillars of Islam?"
- "Explain the concept of Tawhid in Islam"
- "What is the significance of Ramadan in Islam?"
- "How to perform Salah (prayer) in Islam?"
- "What does the Quran say about patience?"
- "Who was Imam Al-Bukhari?"
- "What is the difference between Sunni and Shia Islam?"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- This is an educational tool and not a substitute for consulting with qualified Islamic scholars for religious rulings (fatwas) or personal spiritual guidance.
- The AI may not have knowledge of very recent events or obscure topics.
- While efforts are made to ensure accuracy, users should verify information with authentic Islamic sources.
